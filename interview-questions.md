# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer: Git is commands and systems to move code from local to remote and vis-versa. Github is a specific site for sharing, updating, and displaying git information.

  Researched answer: Git is a free control system tool used for sharing and working on code. Git is used to update and track changes in code, able to have multiple people at a time work on the same code through the command line. Github is a site provider for software development and version control using Git where users can collaborate or adopt open source code.



2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer: JavaScript operators that return Boolean values are relational operators and logical operators.

  Researched answer: Javascript operators that return Boolean values are: equality operators including loose equality operators and strict equality operators, and logical operators including 'and' and 'or' operators.



3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: An index is the position in the array. Index counting starts at 0, then increases from there. The difference between index and value is index is counting the elements, and value is the evaluating the amount in some way being number value or letter value.

  Researched answer: Indexed means that the counting of characters starts at 0 and increases. Values are numbers, pieces of text, functions, and symbols.



4. What is iteration?

  Your answer: An iteration is code doing an action multiple times until a condition is met.

  Researched answer: Iteration is the process of performing an action a certain number of times or until a condition is met, a common form is a for loop.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: Pair programming is two people coding together. One person is the driver, focused on typing the content out. The other person is the navigator, focused on the content being written. It is a technique to go through a code with a partner and communicate out loud the course of the code.

  Researched answer: Pair programming is two people collaborating on code to collectively produce and complete one program. The roles of pair programming are the 'driver' and the 'navigator'. The 'driver' role is focused on using the keyboard and mouse relaying content on the editor. The 'navigator' is focused on watching, advising, thinking, communicating the code content, catching errors, bus, and typos in the code.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: High Order Functions are functions that either absorb another function as an argument or returns an alternate function as the output.

2. Jest: Jest is a Javascript testing framework functioned by yarn, using the describe() method that runs other nested methods.

3. Objects: Objects are datatypes that contain key value pairs. Objects bring in data and methods together.

4. Method: Method is a function that belongs to an object, usually given an action.

5. Classes: Classes are types of functions with data and behavior describing the contents of the object it connects with.
